      <description>Introducing the AWS-CDK AWS recently released the Cloud Development Kit (CDK). According to the authors of the CDK, it is an infrastructure modeling framework that allows you to define your cloud resources using an imperative programming interface.
The AWS CDK is basically a wrapper around CloudFormation, which abstracts CloudFormation definitions of AWS resources into an object-oriented library. This allows developers to define higher-level abstractions of resources, which can easily be reused.</description>
